## Introduction 

NDHU Pigeon Stop is a unity survival game in which the goal is to stop any and all reproducing pigeons from terrorizing the beautiful campus of National Dong Hwa University. Waves of killer pigeons will try to attack you as you run around the CSIE buildings of NDHU. The only way to stop them is to shoot them down before they kill you. This game was designed and built for the final project of my Virtual Reality class. 

## Setup

The NDHU Pigeon Stop unity package was too large to upload to GitHub. However, the EXE file [NDHU Pigeon Stop](https://github.com/Tylereck81/NDHU-Pigeon-Stop/blob/main/NDHU%20PigeonStop.exe) can be downloaded and played directly.

## Instructions 

Controls 
  - WASD keys - Movement (UP, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT)
  - SHIFT+Movement - Run
  - Spacebar - Jump
  - Left-Click - Shoot
  - Mouse Movement - Toggle Aim Camera

There are three main levels, Novice, Expert, and Advanced, that correspond to the survival time. Try to stay alive until the last level!
